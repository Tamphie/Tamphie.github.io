This Project aims to close this gap by developing open, reproducible infrastructure that connects low-level control, data streaming, and high-level learning interfaces. We are building a networking and Python API pipeline that enables remote control and designing actionâ€“observation interfaces for policy training and evaluation directly within the HuggingFace LeRobot ecosystem. The project contributes to the growing open-source robotics community, in collaboration with FrodoBots, HuggingFace, and universities across the globe.
