This Project aims to develop interfaces that connect low-level control, data streaming, and high-level learning. We are building a networking and Python API pipeline that enables remote control and designing actionâ€“observation interfaces for policy training and evaluation. The project contributes to the growing open-source robotics community, in collaboration with FrodoBots, HuggingFace, and universities across the globe.
