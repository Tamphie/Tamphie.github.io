We are building a networking and Python API pipeline that enables remote control of the EarthRover Mini over 4G TCP/IP,and designing actionâ€“observation interfaces that format camera and sensor data for policy training and evaluation directly within the HuggingFace LeRobot ecosystem.
This integration allows seamless collection, calibration, and synchronization of multi-sensor data, supporting large-scale datasets for imitation and reinforcement learning.  
The project contributes to the growing open-source robotics community, in collaboration with **FrodoBots**, **HuggingFace**, and **universities** across the globe.
