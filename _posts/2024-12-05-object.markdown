A core challenge in robot imitation learning lies in the entanglement between a robotâ€™s policy and its specific camera perspectives and object placements. This makes policy generalization difficult. We tackle this by proposing an objectcentric learning framework that decouples observed object motions (vision) and robot actions (motion), allowing generalization over varying viewpoints and object positions.
