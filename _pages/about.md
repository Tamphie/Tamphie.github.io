I am a senior undergraduate student in the [School of Mechanical Engineering](http://mec.xjtu.edu.cn/) at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). 

My research interests lie in advancing robotic manipulation and interaction with the physical world through efficient control, estimation, and learning algorithms. I am fortunate to be advised by  [Prof. David Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dyhsu/) at the AdapComp Lab, [School of Computer Science](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). Previously, I worked under the guidance of [Prof. Xiang Li](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/lixiang) at Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University.

I am applying for Ph.D. programs in Robotics for Fall 2025. My CV is available here:[Tongmiao's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
