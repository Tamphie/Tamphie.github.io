I'm a junior undergraduate student from [School of Mechanical Engineering](http://mec.xjtu.edu.cn/), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). 

My research interests include enhancing robotic manipulation and interaction with the physical world through efficient control, estimation, and learning algorithms. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. David Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dyhsu/) of AdapComp Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). Previously, I was advised by [Prof. Xiang Li](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/lixiang) from Xi'an Jiaotong University. 

I am applying to ph.D. 2025 fall in Robotics. You can find my CV here: [Tongmiao's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Tongmiao's Curriculum Vitae.pdf).
